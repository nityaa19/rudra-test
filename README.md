To control a Sabertooth 2x60 motor driver using serial commands from an RC transmitter via an SBUS receiver, you need to translate the SBUS channel values into commands that the Sabertooth motor driver can understand. Specifically, you want to interpolate the channel values and send them to the motor driver to make the rover move forward or backward.

Here are the steps for the problem solving:
1. Understand the Sabertooth 2x60 Serial Command Format
2.  Interpolate Channel Value
3.  Code Implementation

What I understood:
             So basically we are understanding the implementation of coding in the field of robotics.In robotics the motor are contorlled by pre-defined System instructions. A programmer give input to the preprocessor to take a command over the motor.
             Now a days useage of servo morter and stepper motor increased beacuse of the automation in everything. So beacuse of it the Robotics engineering is booming.
             The robotics is not only the game of mechanical engineering it also involves coding,electronic,electrical,etc.
             In conclusion Everything  works hand in hand.
